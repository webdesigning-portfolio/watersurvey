<h2> WATER STAGNANTION</h2>
<p> 
 Water stagnation occurs when water stops flowing.When this happens it can become an environmental hazard.  <br>
 Too much standing water that isn’t draining can damage flooring and foundations, as well as creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes that are known to carry very harmful diseases.<br>
 When drains are blocked and cleared timely, your health and the structural security of your home is at risk.<br>
 Whether from your kitchen sink, shower or toilet, when water drains from fixtures it’s likely already dirty.<br>
</p>
<h2> THE DANGERS OF STAGNANT WATER </h2>
<p>
Stagnant water attracts rodents and insects. As it soaks into a building’s structure, it damages wood, drywall and concrete. The odor spreads from floor to ceiling. <br>
Stagnant water also hosts dangerous microbial pathogens.<br>
i) Bacteria including salmonella, staphylococcus and E. coli<br>
ii) Viruses such as Norwalk virus, hepatitis E. and rotavirus<br>
iii) Parasites such as cryptosporidium, E. histolytica and giardia<br>
iv) Unhealthy mycotoxins released by toxic black mold fungus<br>
