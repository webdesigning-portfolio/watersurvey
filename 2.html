<h2>DATA COLLECTION</h2>
 
i) We have done the survey on <b>water stagnanted areas </b> in hyderabad. By this process of surveying we get to know about the areas which are in trouble with no proper manholes and drainage canals.<br>
ii)We have collected the information from google and some other kind of sources like information from people living in that areas. <br>
iii)Most of the areas in hyderabad are been suffering from the water stagnantion in there areas during monsoon seasons even for small amount of rainfall.

<h2>HOW TO PREVENT STAGNANT WATER</h2>
Hidden leaks and plumbing problems happen in every home and business. It’s impossible to stop storms from leaving puddles in the yard. Still, you can minimize the chances of water standing and becoming stagnant inside and out.<br>
• Routinely check plumbing for signs of trouble.<br>
• Make sure shingles and gutters stay in good shape.<br>
• Inspect weather seals around doors and windows.<br>
• Eliminate low spots in back and front yards.<br>
• Grade soil to drain away from your property’s foundation.<br>
